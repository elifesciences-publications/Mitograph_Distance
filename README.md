# Mitograph_Distance
Measure the distances between 3D particle position and closest points of the vtk surface file. Works in Paraview as pythond code.

# Random_Walk_Distance
Generate random walk trajectory and measure the distances between the trajectory particle position and closest points of the vtk surface file. Works in Paraview as pythond code.
